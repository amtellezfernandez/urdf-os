# Copy to `.env` (or export in your shell) to configure real policy checkpoints.
#
# A "real checkpoint" for these VLA skills is a LeRobot-exported policy directory/repo_id
# that includes processors + normalization stats. See `so101_vla_demo/README.md` for details.

# Public example SmolVLA checkpoint (includes processor files):
export SMOLVLA_POLICY_ID="Gurkinator/smolvla_so101_policy"

# Optional: your XVLA checkpoint (Hugging Face repo_id or local folder path).
# export XVLA_POLICY_ID="/absolute/path/to/xvla_checkpoint"

# Map policy camera names -> robot camera names.
# Use this if your policy expects cameras named `front`/`wrist` but your robot uses `overhead`/`wrist`, etc.
export SO101_POLICY_CAMERA_MAP='{"front":"overhead","wrist":"wrist"}'

# If you have multiple cameras in the robot config, configure them here too (example):
# export SO101_CAMERA_SOURCES="/dev/video4,/dev/video6"
# export SO101_CAMERA_NAMES="wrist,overhead"
